## Table of Contents
|File Name                                  |Description/Usage                         |
|:------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
|[args.bat](/files/args.bat)|Display the use of spaces with echo.|
|[autoexec.bat](/files/autoexec.bat)|AUTOEXEC.BAT file from PC in L-1. Mostly set commands. PATH is a special command which sets the PATH variable. Notice how the Pervasive.SQL 2000 install has messed up the batch file by putting commands before the @Echo off line.|
|[backbat2.bat](/files/backbat2.bat)|Backup batch files (Windows 95/98/ME version)|
||usage: backbat backupdir|
||where: backupdir is the directory to copy batch files all batch files in the current directory will be backed up|
||Make sure that there is at least one argument. Save the backup directory. Check to make sure that the backupdir exists and isn't a file|
||If the directory does not exist, create it. Because we can't reliably check the errorlevel in Windows 95/98/ME, check if the directory exists after we do the make directory command. Copy each batch file one at a time. Note: the for loop variable (%%b) must be contain only one letter. Use the for loop again to check if each file was copied (since it is difficult to run multiple commands in a for loop).|
||Clean up: unset our variable.|
|[badpath.bat](/files/badpath.bat)|This batch file will mess up your command prompt's PATH setting. Without setlocal and endlocal, set-ting variables changes the DOS environment.|
|[copies.bat](/files/copies.bat)|Check various error levels by running copy commands.|
|[cp.bat](/files/cp.bat)|Copy a file to a new directory, then make it read-only, then try the copy again. The second copy should fail and errorlevel will be set to a non-zero value.|
|[cp2.bat](/files/cp2.bat)|Partial solution to Lab #2.|
|[endless.bat](/files/endless.bat)|Endless loop -- use Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C to stop it.|
|[exist.bat](/files/exist.bat)|Check for existence of a file (testfile) and directory (testdir).|
||Note: this doesn't seem to work on Microsoft Networking network drives (such as W: in L-17).|
||testfile is a file|
||testdir is NOT a file|
||testfile is NOT a directory|
||testdir is a directory|
|[go.bat](/files/go.bat)|An infinite loop -- use Ctrl+Break or Ctrl+C to stop it.|
|[go2.bat](/files/go2.bat)|A conditional loop -- continues until no more arguments are left on the command line.|
|[hello.bat](/files/hello.bat)|Hello world program.|
|[keep.bat](/files/keep.bat)|Save the first parameter in the saved variable.|
||The shift command moves the %1 to %0 and %2 to %1, so that the previous value is replaced.|
||If we do another shift, the original %1 (now %0) gets lost.|
||Since we stored in the saved variable, we can recover the value. With named (as opposed to numbered) variables, you have to use a percent sign before and after the variable name to get the value.|
|[main1.bat](/files/main1.bat)|Demonstrate call command to execute another batch file (sub).|
|[main2.bat](/files/main2.bat)|Demonstrate call with setting variables and passing parameters.|
|[mbcopy.bat](/files/mbcopy.bat)|One possible solution to Lab #2, Part B.|
||MBCOPY.BAT copies any number of files or directories to to a directory. The command uses the following syntax:|
||mbcopy dest src1 src2 ...|
||If the destination directory does not exist, create it|
||If the source file is a directory, it gets copied differently from an ordinary file.|
||If the source directory does not already exist in the destination directory, create it so that XCOPY does not prompt the user.|
|[mycopy.bat](/files/mycopy.bat)|MYCOPY.BAT copies any number of files to a directory. The command uses the following syntax:|
||mycopy dir file1 file2 ...|
|[myvar.bat](/files/myvar.bat)|Set a variable which will remain in the DOS environment after the batch file is completed. To verify this, enter set at the DOS prompt after you run this batch file.|
|[myvar2.bat](/files/myvar2.bat)|Set a variable which will not affect the DOS environment after the batch file is completed. To verify this, enter set at the DOS prompt after you run this batch file. Combine this and myvar.bat to see what happens. Note: Windows NT or 2000 only.|
|[p.bat](/files/p.bat)|Set the PATH on the network in L-17.|
|[param.bat](/files/param.bat)|You can access up to nine command-line parameters at any given time.|
|[param2.bat](/files/param2.bat)|You can access up to nine command-line parameters at any given time, but you can choose to access only selected parameters, and ignore the rest.|
|[param3.bat](/files/param3.bat)|The shift command can be used to process each command-line parameter, one at a time, using the %1 variable.|
|[param4.bat](/files/param4.bat)|shift can be used when you need to process more than nine parameters.|
|[param5.bat](/files/param5.bat)|shift can be used when you need to process more than nine parameters; you can still access only nine at a time.|
|[rems.bat](/files/rems.bat)|This is a comment.|
|[rems2.bat](/files/rems2.bat)|More comments.|
|[Remove_Cbs_Logs.bat](/files/Remove_Cbs_Logs.bat)|This is caused by Windows Resource Protection (WRP), which stops programs overwriting essential system files. It keeps its log files in C:\Windows\Logs\CBS. The SFC.exe program writes the details of each verification operation and of each repair operation to the CBS.log file. The CBS.persist.log is generated when the CBS gets to be around 50Mb in size. CBS.log is copied to cbs.persist.log and a new cbs.log file is started. The cbs logs would only be useful for serious troubleshooting issues. If the system is running fine, we can delete this file and SFC.exe will create a new one the next time it is run. So why do we have this mysterious process writing a files in the temp folder?? It appears that on a number of servers we can see the SFC archive process has failed to recycle properly and as a result had been running for a long time.|
|[safepath.bat](/files/safepath.bat)|This batch file will not affect the DOS PATH. Note: Windows NT or 2000 only.|
|[safepath9x.bat](/files/safepath9x.bat)|This batch file will not affect the DOS PATH, by making a copy of the PATH variable beforehand, and restoring it at the end of the batch file.|
|[shift.bat](/files/shift.bat)|Demonstrate shift command.|
|[shifter.bat](/files/shifter.bat)|Demonstrate shift command (no echo).|
|[str1.bat](/files/str1.bat)|This demonstrates the form of the if command comparing strings. If you run this batch file without any parameters, you will get an error message.|
|[str2.bat](/files/str2.bat)|This demonstrates the correct form of the if command for comparing strings. If you run this batch file without any parameters, you will not get an error message, because the empty quotes will be on both the left side and on the right side. In the previous batch file (str1.bat) the left side would be blank, causing an error.|
|[str3.bat](/files/str3.bat)|The alternative form of string comparison. In this case, the dot takes up space on the left side if no parameter is given.|
|[sub.bat](/files/sub.bat)|This is the batch file called by both main1.bat and main2.bat. It demonstrates the use of shared variables and parameters passed by the call command.|
|[tf1.bat](/files/tf1.bat)|Demonstrates incorrect if command. If true, goto end. Otherwise, both echo statements are executed.|
|[tf2.bat](/files/tf2.bat)|Demonstrates correct if command. If true, only one echo statement is shown. If false, only one echo statement is is also shown, because the following goto skips over the second (true case) echo command.|
|[tf3.bat](/files/tf3.bat)|Negative form of if command. Here, the not keyword is used to goto the false case; otherwise, the true case is executed immediately following the if. Then we skip over the false case with a second goto.|
|[tf4.bat](/files/tf4.bat)|Demonstates a if-else condition. If the first if is true, then we go to the first case. If the first if is false, then we check the second if. If that if is true, then we go to the second case. If both ifs are false, the else case is executed.|
|[tf5.bat](/files/tf5.bat)|Alternate form of if-elseif-else structure with goto for else case. That way, you can group code together in a more logical or more natural manner.|
|[tf6.bat](/files/tf6.bat)|Demonstrates a logical OR condition. Both if commands goto the same label if true. Otherwise, both are false.|
|[zero.bat](/files/zero.bat)|Batch file command line is copied to %0.|
